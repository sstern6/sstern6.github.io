<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hey! My name is Scott and I'm currently living in Los Angeles, CA. I recently graduate college at Loyola Marymount University with a major in Business Administration and an emphasis in Marketing.  I started my professional career in online marketing operations and consulting since I've graduated.  During college, I spent some time in User Experience Design classes, which sparked my initial interest into the technology industry.  But currently, I'm on the long and exciting path to becoming a developer.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, I'm a novice developer learning software development at Dev Bootcamp SF.  I'm in the middle of Phase 0, which is the remote stage of Dev Bootcamp before everyone in the program moves to San Francisco for our 9 weeks on site.
</p>

  When I'm not working I enjoy anything outdoors from cycling to rock climbing to surfing.  I also enjoy spending time with friends and family.  In my spare time I "attempt" to teach myself flamenco guitar, specifically rumba, and I have a fascination with languages from all around the world.
</p>

<p>
  Fun Fact: When I was in high school I raced road bikes competitively at the international level.  When I graduated high school I moved to Belgium to race all around northern Europe.  While I was in Europe, I had the opportunity to race with the United States Junior National Team. Click <a href="http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/vf392gdq" target="_blank">HERE</a> for proof.
