  <h1>DBC Culture Blog</h1>

        My take on the DBC experience is that Dev Bootcamp focuses on providing the tools to be a successful software engineer, DBC does not just focus on teaching their students how to code in a few languages.  This is important because the technology industry is always changing, and people who will be successful need to be able to adapt to the changes within the industry.  I strongly believe what you put into DBC, you will get out of it.

        I see myself engaging with this type of culture by fully immersing myself in the experience and learning as much as I can throughout the 18 weeks of Dev Bootcamp's curriculum.  After watching the video, my expectations haven't changed with DBC, but my approach has changed for the better to be prepared for week 1 onsite in San Francisco.  I am very excited to participate in this type of learning environment in order to effectively learn a new skill.

        I think with any new experience it's healthy to be nervous.  And with starting DBC I am a little bit nervous for the onsite Phase 1-3 at DBC and the workload, but a good nervous.  The nervous I am feeling is an excited nervous, to learn, be challenged, and build things in code I couldn't before.
