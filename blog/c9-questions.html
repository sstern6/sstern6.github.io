<h1>Good Questions????</h1>

<p>
  The biggest part of learning at Dev Bootcamp is asking questions to guides and peers.  However, if you don't know how to ask the right question you might be spending more time not getting to the right place to help you move forward.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>No.1 - Before asking a question<br></br></strong>

  -Make sure you have spent a significant amount of time going down rabbit holes to see if you can solve it on your own(time boxing of course). My best learning experiences have been the time spent trying over and over to solve a problem by getting no where at first, then stepping away for a little bit, and finally coming back with a fresh set of eyes

</p>

<p>
  <strong>No.2  - Asking a question.....be specific and concise<br></br></strong>

 -When asking a question it is important to be specific, clear, and to the point.  This ensures you limit confusion and can take up the least amount of time (for both parties) as possible.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>No.3 - Be honest<br></br></strong>

  -Asking a question can lead to other unanswered questions when trying to solve problems. If you find you don't know something, SPEAK UP!  Make sure you understand every step before proceeding because down the road all of the little things can pile up to big problems that could have been prevented by asking good questions and communicating.  Communication is one of the most important things I have learned thus far at DBC.
</p>

<p>
   <strong>No.4 - Repeat Back!<br></br></strong>

  -Make sure you repeat what you have learned to make sure you donâ€™t have to ask the same question later.  This makes the question asking process more efficient and limits unnecessary time spent asking multiple people the same question.
