<h1>What is Rails?</h1>

<p>
  At Dev Bootcamp, we have been spending a lot of time in the ruby language. However, this week we spent A LOT of time in JavaScript. Each language has its own frameworks, and the most popular among ruby developers is a framework called "rails".
</p>

<p>
  What is "rails"?  Rails is an open source web framework, written in the ruby language in order to make web development easier and more efficient by assuming what software developers need to get started.  Rails has certain "best practices" it follows in order to limit the amount of code developers need to write for a web application. One of these best practices is DRY(don't repeat yourself).
</p>

<p>
What makes ruby on rails so popular is its application to a variety of companies regardless of their size.  Most notably, ruby on rails has been used to build Twitter.

  I hope you learned a little bit more about ruby and its real life application!
