<h1>Ruby Docs vs JavaScript Docs</h1>

<p>
  Ruby and JavaScript have a lot of similarities and a lot of differences.  The differences seem to be of a syntactic nature between the two languages but functionality seems similar.
</p>

<p>
  When you donâ€™t know how the syntax works or the full functionality of something specific in a computer language, where do you look? THE DOCS!  Ruby documentation and JavaScript documentation seem to be a common tab on my browser since starting DBC.  Although they both do they same thing, inform, they are very different in how they present information for each respective language.
</p>

<p>
  The JavaScript Mozilla developer documentation is very detailed and organized with endless examples and explanations.  On the other hand, the Ruby Docs give a detailed description of capabilities of the language but do not give a lot of examples in order to use the code.  This is more of a get thrown into the ocean and you can sink or swim.  HOWEVER, although the Ruby Docs are a little bit more generalized and don't hold your hand through the coding process, we have access to Interactive Ruby, or IRB.  IRB allows for us to see the concepts on the Ruby Docs and play with them before implementing our new found ideas and concepts into code.
</p>

<p>
  In the end, the main difference of the documentation is detail.  JavaScript documents have so much detail, but Ruby has IRB. It's not a question of which one is better, it's a question of which language you're working on! But Ruby has IRB.

  Thanks for reading!
