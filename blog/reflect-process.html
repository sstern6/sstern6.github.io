<h1>My Experience This Far - Personal Site Edition</h1>

<p>
  Working on my own site has been a great experience in itself.  How do I portray myself to the world on the web?  What colors do I want to use?  Are there too many colors? Is my site clean?  Does my site make sense? Does my site present a good overall experience to the user.  These are questions I ask myself on a daily basis when considering how to improve my site.  Granted, at the moment the site only contains static pages, but Iâ€™m enjoying the journey to more complicated things.
</p>

<p>
  Another thing I've noticed from having my own site, it's never good enough. Everyday I look at it and find something I want to change or make better.  The hard part is knowing how to implement my new found idea.  After hours of research and playing around with HTML and/or CSS, it usually works out......usually.
