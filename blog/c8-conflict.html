<h1>Conflicts</h1>

<p>
  This wee at DBC we were asked to analyze a conflict and break it down into simple, digestible parts in order to resolve the conflict in a more logical manner.  Here we go........
</p>

<p>
1)Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?<br></br>

-In the past, I have made plans with acquaintances at a certain time, when I would show up at or around the specified time I would find myself waiting for the better part of an hour to meet for a coffee or lunch.

</p>

<p>
  2)What was the source of the conflict?<br></br>

  -The source of the conflict was that I felt disrespected and my time was not as important to the other person as their time was to me.  Out of this I would either need to leave and upset the person I was meeting or readjust my whole day.
</p>

<p>
  3)What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?<br></br>

  -Frustration
</p>

<p>
  4)What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?<br></br>

  -If this occurred more than once, I would then request for that person to let me know when they were leaving to the designated meeting spot in order to readjust my schedule and not feel like I was wasting my time waiting for them to show up.
</p>


<p>
  5)If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?<br></br>

  -Yes, I would approach the situation with less frustration, things come up all the time.  It's not worth ruining a relationship over the small things in life.

</p>

<p>
  6)What did you learn from this experience?<br></br>
  -I learned how to be empathetic and patient towards other people's situations and needs.  In addition, I learned the importance of communication and planning ahead.
